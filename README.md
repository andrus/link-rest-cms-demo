# link-rest-cms-demo
A simple JAX RS project demonstrating the use of [LinkRest](https://github.com/nhl/link-rest) framework

* Requires Java 1.8 or newer
* Requires a servlet 3.1 container (though will probably work on 3.0) 

How a "real app" would be different from this example:

* Instead of using an in-memory Derby database, you may want to connect Cayenne stack to a real DB and scrub the code of all the references to Derby.
